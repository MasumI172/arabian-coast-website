# Domain Reset Issue - Morning Access Problem

## Issue
Domain showed "brand new" message this morning after working yesterday.

## Likely Causes
1. **Domain verification reset** - TXT record may have expired
2. **DNS propagation fluctuation** - Temporary routing issues
3. **Replit maintenance** - System updates can reset domain status
4. **Primary domain not set** - Still defaulting to replit.app

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Re-verify Domain in Replit
- Go to Replit Deployments → Settings → Domains
- Check if arabiancoastholidayhomes.com still shows "Verified" ✅
- If not verified, click "Verify Domain" again
- Add/confirm TXT record in mywebb DNS panel

### 2. Set as Primary Domain
- Stop current deployment
- Redeploy with arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as primary
- This prevents morning access issues

### 3. DNS Record Check
Ensure mywebb has:
```
A Record: @ → 34.132.134.162
A Record: www → 34.132.134.162
TXT Record: @ → replit-user=[verification-string]
```

### 4. Alternative Access
While fixing, try:
- https://www.arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try different browser/incognito mode

## Prevention
Setting arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as PRIMARY domain prevents these morning reset issues, as it makes your custom domain the authoritative source rather than a secondary redirect.

## Expected Resolution Time
- Domain re-verification: 5-15 minutes
- Primary domain setting: Immediate after redeployment
- SSL certificate: 2-4 hours if reset
