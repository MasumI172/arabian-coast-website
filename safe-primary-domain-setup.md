# Safe Primary Domain Setup - Alternative Methods

## Current Situation
- Domain arabiancoastholidayhomes.com is verified ✅
- "Shutdown" shows as "Delete Deployment" 
- Need safer method to set primary domain

## Alternative Methods (Try These First)

### Method 1: Direct Primary Domain Setting
- In Deployments → Settings → Domains
- Look for "Actions" or "..." menu next to arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- Check for "Set as Primary" or "Make Primary" option
- This may be available without shutdown

### Method 2: Deployment Settings
- Go to main deployment settings (not domains section)
- Look for "Primary Domain" or "Default Domain" dropdown
- Select arabiancoastholidayhomes.com from list
- Save changes

### Method 3: Environment Configuration
- Check if there's an "Environment" or "Configuration" section
- Look for domain-related settings
- May allow primary domain selection without redeployment

## If No Alternative Options Available

### Safe Redeployment Process:
1. **Document current settings** - Screenshot all domain configurations
2. **Backup verification codes** - Save TXT record values
3. **Delete and recreate** - Only if no other options exist
4. **Immediately re-add domain** - Use saved verification codes

## Expected Behavior After Primary Domain Set
- arabiancoastholidayhomes.com becomes authoritative
- SSL certificate should activate properly
- No more "brand new" messages
- Stable 24/7 access

## Safety Note
Your domain verification is complete and stable. Even if you need to recreate the deployment, the domain ownership is established with your DNS provider.
