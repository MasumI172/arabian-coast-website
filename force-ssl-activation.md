# Force SSL Certificate Activation

## Current Status
Domain: arabiancoastholidayhomes.com is verified ✅
SSL: Still showing replit.app certificate instead of custom domain certificate

## Methods to Force SSL Activation

### Method 1: Domain Refresh in Replit
1. Go to Deployments → Domains
2. Click the edit/pencil icon next to arabiancoastholidayhomes.com  
3. Look for "Refresh SSL" or "Renew Certificate" option
4. Click to force SSL regeneration

### Method 2: Unlink and Re-link Domain (Safest Force Method)
1. In Domains section, temporarily unlink arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
2. Wait 2-3 minutes  
3. Re-add the domain using the same TXT verification
4. This forces fresh SSL certificate generation

### Method 3: Set as Primary Domain (Forces SSL)
Since domain is verified, setting as primary often triggers SSL:
1. Use the shutdown/redeploy method we discussed
2. During redeployment, set arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as primary
3. This typically forces SSL certificate generation

### Method 4: Contact Replit Support
If other methods don't work:
- Use Replit's support chat/tickets
- Reference: "Domain verified but SSL certificate not provisioning for 24+ hours"
- They can manually trigger SSL generation

## Expected Timeline After Forcing
- SSL certificate generation: 15 minutes - 2 hours
- Browser recognition: Immediate after generation
- Global propagation: Complete within 2-4 hours
