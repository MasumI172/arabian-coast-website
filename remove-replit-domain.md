# Removing Default Replit Domain

## Goal
Remove `arabian-coast-homes-masum987670.replit.app` from domains, keeping only `arabiancoastholidayhomes.com` as the sole domain.

## Important Note
**You cannot completely remove the default replit.app domain** - it's automatically generated for every Replit deployment. However, you can:

1. **Set arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as primary** (which you're doing)
2. **Hide/disable the replit.app domain from public access**
3. **Ensure all traffic redirects to your custom domain**

## Steps in Replit Deployments:

### Option 1: Domain Configuration
- In deployment settings â†’ Domains
- Look for options to "Disable" or "Hide" the replit.app domain
- Set custom domain as "Primary" and "Only Public Domain"

### Option 2: Redirect Configuration
- Configure automatic redirects from replit.app to your custom domain
- This effectively makes the replit.app domain invisible to users

### Option 3: Access Control
- Some Replit plans allow restricting access to only custom domains
- Check deployment settings for "Domain Access" or "Public Access" options

## Expected Result
- Users can only access via arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- Replit.app domain either redirects or shows "not found"
- Professional appearance with only your branded domain visible

## Technical Reality
The replit.app subdomain will always exist in the backend (Replit requires it for their infrastructure), but it can be made inaccessible to the public.
