# Domain Verification Steps for arabiancoastholidayhomes.com

## Current Status
Your website IS working - the domain serves the correct HTML content when accessed programmatically. The "brand new site" message appears due to SSL/verification issues.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Complete Domain Verification in Replit
**Access your Replit Deployment:**
- Go to https://replit.com/deployments
- Find your Arabian Coast Holiday Homes deployment
- Click on Settings → Domains
- Check if arabiancoastholidayhomes.com shows as "Verified" ✅

**If showing "Pending" or "Failed":**
- Click "Verify Domain" again
- Ensure your mywebb DNS has the correct TXT record from Replit

### 2. Required DNS Records (Verify in mywebb)
```
A Record:
- Name: @
- Value: 34.132.134.162
- TTL: 300

A Record:
- Name: www  
- Value: 34.132.134.162
- TTL: 300

TXT Record (get exact value from Replit):
- Name: @
- Value: replit-user=[your-verification-string]
- TTL: 300
```

### 3. Clear Browser Cache
After verification:
- Clear browser cache completely
- Try accessing in incognito/private mode
- Test on different devices/networks

### 4. Alternative Access Methods
While waiting for full propagation:
- Try https://www.arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- Access directly without www
- Use different browsers

## What "Brand New Site" Means
This message typically appears when:
- Domain verification is incomplete in Replit
- SSL certificate hasn't finished provisioning
- Browser is showing a default landing page instead of your site

## Expected Timeline
- Domain verification: Immediate (once DNS records are correct)
- SSL certificate: 2-24 hours after verification
- Full propagation: Up to 48 hours globally

## Confirmation Test
Your site IS working - the HTML shows your Arabian Coast content. The issue is just the verification/SSL layer.
