# Setting Primary Domain - Final Steps

## Current Status
✅ arabiancoastholidayhomes.com is VERIFIED (green status)
⚠️ Still needs to be set as PRIMARY domain

## Why Primary Domain is Critical
- Prevents "brand new" messages in the morning
- Makes your custom domain the authoritative source
- Ensures stable, consistent access
- Professional branding without interruptions

## Exact Steps to Set as Primary

### In Your Replit Deployments Dashboard:

1. **Stop Current Deployment**
   - Click "Stop Deployment" or "Shutdown" button
   - Wait for status to show "Stopped"

2. **Start New Deployment**
   - Click "Deploy" to redeploy
   - During deployment setup, look for domain configuration
   - Select arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as PRIMARY domain
   - Complete deployment

3. **Alternative Method (if available)**
   - Some Replit interfaces have a "Set as Primary" button
   - Look for this option next to your verified domain
   - Click to make it primary without full redeployment

## Expected Results After Setting Primary
- arabiancoastholidayhomes.com becomes the main domain
- No more "brand new" messages
- SSL certificate should activate properly
- Consistent access 24/7

## Timeline
- Deployment process: 2-5 minutes
- Primary domain activation: Immediate
- SSL completion: Should finish during this process

This will resolve the morning access issues permanently.
