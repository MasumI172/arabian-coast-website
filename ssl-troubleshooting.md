# SSL Certificate Troubleshooting for arabiancoastholidayhomes.com

## Current Status
- **Domain**: arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- **Issue**: SSL certificate mismatch (cert not matching custom domain)
- **DNS**: Correctly pointing to Replit servers
- **Website**: Accessible via HTTPS but with certificate warnings

## Root Cause
The SSL certificate hasn't been properly provisioned for your custom domain yet. This is common during the initial 24-48 hour period after domain linking.

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Verify Domain Configuration in Replit
- Go to your Replit Deployment dashboard
- Navigate to Settings → Domains
- Ensure arabiancoastholidayhomes.com is listed and verified
- Check that the status shows "Active" or "Verified"

### 2. Force SSL Certificate Renewal
If the domain shows as verified but SSL is still failing:
- In Replit Deployments, try unlinking and re-linking the domain
- This forces a new SSL certificate generation

### 3. DNS Verification
Current DNS records are correct:
```
arabiancoastholidayhomes.com → 34.132.134.162
```

### 4. Wait for SSL Propagation
SSL certificates can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate after domain verification.

## Timeline
- **Domain linking**: Completed
- **DNS propagation**: Complete
- **SSL certificate**: In progress (typically 2-24 hours)

## Temporary Workaround
Users can access the site by:
1. Proceeding through the browser warning (not recommended for production)
2. Using the original Replit domain temporarily
3. Waiting for SSL to complete provisioning

## Expected Resolution
SSL certificate should automatically provision within 24 hours of domain verification. No action required from your end - this is handled automatically by Replit's infrastructure.
