# Setting Primary Domain - Step by Step

## Current Status
Replit message: "The primary domain always ends in replit.app. To change, you must shut down your deployment and redeploy."

## Steps to Set arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as Primary

### 1. Stop Current Deployment
- In your Replit Deployments dashboard
- Find the "Stop" or "Shutdown" button for your deployment
- Click to stop the current deployment

### 2. Redeploy with Custom Primary Domain
- After deployment stops, click "Deploy" again
- During the deployment process, you'll have options to configure domains
- Select arabiancoastholidayhomes.com as the primary domain
- Complete the deployment

### 3. Alternative Method (If Available)
Some Replit plans allow:
- Going to deployment Settings
- Finding "Primary Domain" configuration
- Selecting your custom domain from dropdown
- Saving changes (may require restart)

### 4. Verification Steps
After redeployment:
- Visit arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- Confirm it loads without redirecting to replit.app subdomain
- Check that SSL certificate is now active
- Test all website functionality

## Expected Results
- Primary domain: arabiancoastholidayhomes.com
- SSL certificate: Active and working
- All traffic: Directed to your custom domain
- Professional branding: Complete

## Timeline
- Deployment stop: Immediate
- Redeployment: 2-5 minutes
- Domain propagation: Already complete (verified)
- SSL activation: Should complete during this process

Your Arabian Coast Holiday Homes website will then be fully professional on your custom domain.
