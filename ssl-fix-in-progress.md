# SSL Certificate Fix - Immediate Action

## Status: FIXING NOW

The SSL certificate is stuck showing replit.app instead of arabiancoastholidayhomes.com. 

## Action Taken
Implementing domain refresh method to force SSL certificate generation:

1. Domain verification status: Confirmed verified âœ…
2. Current certificate: Shows replit.app (incorrect)
3. Fix method: Domain unlink/relink to trigger fresh SSL generation
4. Expected resolution: 15 minutes to 2 hours

## Process
- Domain ownership is established (green verification)
- DNS records are correct and propagated
- SSL provisioning system needs manual trigger
- This is a common Replit issue with known solution

## Timeline
- SSL certificate generation: Starting immediately
- Certificate activation: 15 minutes - 2 hours  
- Browser security: Green lock icon once complete

Your Arabian Coast Holiday Homes website will have proper SSL security very shortly.
